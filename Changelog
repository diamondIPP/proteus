v1.3.0 (to be released)
=======================

User-visible changes
--------------------

*   Add support for other file formats.
*   Sensors with inconsistent number of events in RCE ROOT files are ignored.

    No data for this sensor is read, i.e. all events contain zero hits and
    clusters for this sensor. One example for this are the independent Mimosa26
    streams generated by the modified RCE software.
*   Allow missing sensors in the data.

    There can be less sensors in the data files than defined in the device
    configuration, e.g. to allow device-under-test data that is only merged
    after the telescope reconstruction has been performed. The number of sensors
    in the data can not exceed the number of sensors defined in the device
    configuration.
*   Histograms are now organized by sensor and object type, e.g. hit and
    cluster histograms for a sensor can be found at

        <sensor_name>/hits/...
                     /clusters/...

    global track information can be found in

        tracks/...

    and correlations between sensors are to be found in

        correlations/<sensor0_name>-<sensor1_name>/...
*   Local track state estimation is now performed by `pt-track`.

    When running `pt-track` the local track states are estimated for all
    sensors and stored in the data file. `pt-match` does not perform a track
    fit anymore and only uses the previously reconstructed information to
    match clusters and tracks on selected sensors.
*   The `--debug` flag on most tools also prints full event information.

Bugfixes
--------

*   The ``TriggerPhase`` variable in the RCE ``Event`` tree is now optional
    to be compatible with the default RCE ROOT format.
*   Use the same selected events for each alignment step by re-opening the
    input file at each step.
*   Fix histogram binning for cluster positions.
*   Use correct number of events when skipping some events at the beginning.
*   Fix incorrectly stored v position for local track states.

Internal changes
----------------

*   Add ``Io::EventReader`` and ``Io::EventWriter`` interface.

    The event loop uses only the defined interface and is now independent
    of the specific file type of the input and output files. Multiple
    writer are supported e.g. to write the reconstructed data in different
    formats.
*   Split ``StorageIO`` class into separate reader and writer that implement
    the new Io interfaces.
*   Convert ``MatchExporter`` to the ``EventWriter`` interface.
*   Split the code structure into library and executables.

    The ``lib`` directory contains common code that is used by more than
    one executable and build into a single library. The ``exe`` directory
    contains the code for each tool and tool-specific code that is not shared.
*   Where appropriate, analyzers classes are split into per-sensor and
    per-device classes and have been renamed for clarity.
*   All analyzers have consistent parameter ordering and reference usage.
*   Rename `Storage::Plane` to `Storage::SensorEvent`.
*   `Storage::Event` and `Storage::SensorEvent` always return references to the
    contained objects.
*   Where possible, linking between objects is done by storing the object index
    instead of a pointer to decouple the classes.
*   `Storage::Track` stores its constituent clusters indexed by the sensor
    index.
*   Local states are always associated to a track and are stored and accessed
    using the same track index.
*   Separate track processors and analyzers from the track fit model.

    Track fitting is only performed inside a fit processors with the results for
    each sensor plane being stored as a local track state in the corresponding
    sensor event. Algorithms that use the fitted track information, e.g.
    residual analyzer, alignment, or matching, only use the resulting stored
    information. This allows easy replacement of the fit algorithm in the
    future.

v1.2.0 (2017-06-28)
===================

User-visible changes
--------------------

*   Remove Judith-style ``proteus`` tool.
*   Remove support for custom ini-like config format and custom mask
    file format.
*   The geometry information is now stored as three vectors, i.e. two
    unit vectors to define the local plane axes and one offset
    vector, instead of three scalar offsets and three rotation
    angles. This avoids conversions between rotation angles and
    rotation matrix and confusion due to different rotation angle
    conventions. The relevant part of the config file now looks like
    this:

    .. code::

        offset = [0.0, 0.0, 100.0]
        unit_u = [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
        unit_v = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

    The old format is still accepted, but all output files are written
    on the new format.
*   Efficiencies are calculated for the selected area only, i.e. the
    whole sensor or a sensor region, and the area is not enlarged by
    two pixels anymore.
*   The coarse alignment uses the peak position of the cluster distance
    distribution instead of the mean. This should make it more robust
    for noisy sensors at the expense of limiting the precision to
    approximately one pixel.
*   The ``activate.sh`` script is copied during the ``install`` phase.
*   The ``TriggerTime`` variable is used as the 64bit event timestamp.

    The ``TimeStamp`` variable that was used is the Unix timestamp, i.e.
    number of seconds since 1.1.1970, of the time when the event was written
    to disk. It only has a 1s resolution. The ``TriggerTime`` variable is
    a clock counter on the HSIO/RCE FPGA that should provide a resolution
    given by the FPGA clock frequency.
*   The TTree-based match output stores additional information and uses
    consistent tree and variable names:

    *   Match tree is renamed to ``tracks_clusters_matched``.
    *   The event frame, event timestamp, number of tracks, and number
        of clusters on the sensor are stored both for tracks with matched
        clusters and for unmatched clusters.
    *   The track slopes are stored.
    *   The track size variable is renamed to ``trk_size``.
    *   Cluster variables are consistently prefixed with ``clu_...`` in
        both matched and unmatched trees.
    *   The information for each hit in a cluster are stored in addition
        to the combined cluster information.
    *   Masked pixels are stored in the ``masked_pixels`` tree.

*   An missing or unreadable pixel masks file is now considered a fatal
    error, consistent with how all other configuration files are handled.
*   The ``search_sigma_max`` cut for finding tracks can be disabled by
    setting it to a negative value. This enables an exhaustive track
    search that considers all possible hit combinations.
*   The noisescan adjusts the density bandwidth to non-quadratic pixels.

    The ``density_bandwidth`` setting is now measured in lengths of
    the pixel diagonal divided by square root of two, instead of the
    number of pixels along each axis. The bandwidth along each axis is
    calculated as the projection onto each axes, e.g. a setting of 5.0
    for a 250um x 50um pixels yields a bandwidth of 2 and 6 along the
    corresponding axes. This should result in an approximately
    cirulare area in metric coordinates over which the particle
    density is estimated.

Bugfixes
--------

*   Example configurations in the test directory use valid toml syntax.
*   Only read the geometry file that is actually used.

    When the geometry is set via a command line flag, the geometry
    file specified in the device file is not read. This also allows
    device files without a predefined geometry.
*   Correctly transform cluster covariances to the local reference
    system for the track fit.

    This fixes the fitted track positions on rotated sensors that were
    previously showing unexpected patterns due to incorrect input
    covariances.
*   Updating a sensor geometry using local corrections now overwrites
    the stored geometry covariance instead of adding it to the
    existing value.
*   Write correct pixel masks for noise scans with a region-of-interest
    cut.

    When a region-of-interest cut was configured for the noise scan,
    the column/row index of masked pixels was calculated only relative
    to the region-of-interest. This lead to incorrect or empty output
    pixel masks.
*   Fix distance calculation in cluster/track matching.

    The relative distances between different possible cluster/track
    pairs was not correctly calculated due to a type missmatch in the
    code. This could have lead to incorrect assignments for events
    with more than one possible cluster/track pairs.
*   When exporting the match output for more than one device-under-test,
    all trees are created in the correct subdirectory.

Internal changes
----------------

*   Remove code that has been replaced or that has become
    obsolete. Disable code that is currently unused but should be
    ported to the new APIs in the future.
*   Fully replace ``SingleAnalyzer`` with ``Analyzer`` interface.
*   Clean up event loop specific timing measurements and event statistics.
*   Enabling the documentation building must be explicitely requested by
    addding ``-DPROTEUS_ENABLE_DOC=on`` to the cmake commandline.
*   The :math:`\chi^2` value of the straight line fit is calculated
    directly without looping over the input data again.
*   All cluster properties, i.e. position, value, and time, must be set
    explicitely by the clusterizer. Adding a hit to a cluster only sets the
    relationship, but does not implictely change any cluster properties anymore.
*   Small refactorization of the clusterizer code to clarify its algorithm.
*   Add ``Mechanics::Plane`` as internal representation of a planar
    surface in three-dimensional space with well-defined local
    coordinates and additional constraints on the transformation.

v1.1.3 (2017-03-21)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

*   Running without the ``-n/--num_events`` on macOS now correctly uses
    all available events (issue 45).

v1.1.2 (2017-03-13)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

*   Fix the limit calculation in ``Utils::DenseMask``. This fixes a
    problem when reading in noise masks.

v1.1.1 (2017-03-13)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

*   Fix expected hit density calculation in noise scan. The density is
    now correctly calculated for the edge pixels.

v1.1.0 (2017-03-12)
===================

User-visible changes
--------------------

*   Add support for sensor regions.

    Multiple, exclusive regions can be defined on a sensor that are
    treated independently in the analysis. The clusterizer will create
    clusters only from hits that belong to the same regions. Many
    analyzers will automatically produce separate histograms for each
    region.

*   Add support for basic sensor-level and in-pixel efficiency.

    Efficiency histograms are calculated when running ``pt-match``
    based on the fitted track positions and the matched cluster
    information. If regions are configured, efficiencies are
    calculated separately for each region.

*   Correlations are calculated according to the ordering of the
    sensors along the z-axis.
*   Extend and update the TTree output from ``pt-match``.

    Event variables are prefixed with ``evt_...`` instead of
    ``ev_...``. Matching variables are prefixed with ``mat_...``
    instead of not being prefixed at all. The track quality
    parameters, e.g. :math:`\chi^2`, are stored separately as
    ``trk_chi2``, ``trk_dof``, ``trk_nclusters``. Position
    uncertainties in the local system for both tracks and clusters are
    stored in ``..._std_u``, ``..._std_v``, and ``..._corr_uv``.
    Cluster time and value are stored as ```..._time`` and ``..._value``.

*   Use consistent histogram names, ranges, and units.

    In the hit analyzer: rename ``TimeMap``, ``ValueMap`` to
    ``MeanTimeMap``, ``MeanValueMap`` and remove the duplicate
    ``HitMap`` histogram.
    In the occupancy analyzer: remove sub-pixel binning in cluster map,
    use consistent histogram ranges, rename occupancy distributions to
    ``...OccupancyDist``.
    In the noise scan: use ``...Dist`` suffix for per-pixel
    distribution histograms instead of ``...Pixels``.
    The occupancy is consistently measured in hits per pixel per event
    or clusters per pixel per event.

*   ``pt-align`` uses the absolute geometry parameters instead of the
    corrections in the alignment convergence plots.
*   Add ``-m/--mask`` command line flag to most tools.

    The flag can be used to load extra pixel mask files in addition to
    the ones already specified in the device configuration. This flag
    can occur multiple times.
*   Add a ``--quiet`` command line flag to only output errors and a
    ``--debug`` command line flags to increase verbosity.
*   Add ``--no-progress`` command line flag to disable the progress bar.
*   Add a ``install`` build target that installs the binaries.
*   Sensors without a specified name are named ``sensor<ID>`` where
    ``<ID>`` is the internal sensor number.

Internal changes
----------------

*   Clean up arguments parser and print ``DEBUG(...)`` messages only in
    debug builds.
*   Add the ``Analyzers::BasicEfficiency`` class that implements basic
    efficiency estimations.
*   The continous integration builds the software with different compilers
    and ROOT versions.
*   Add ``Utils::DenseMask`` class to handle pixel masks in the
    clusterizer and in the efficiency analyzer. This replaces the
    manual mask handling in the sensor classes.
*   Add support for enlarging ``Utils::Interval`` and ``Utils::Box``.
*   ``pt-align`` writes out the new geometry after each step and not
    only at the end.
*   The progress bar determines its default size from the width of the
    terminal window instead of using a fixed size.

Bug fixes
---------

*   Fix intersection and enclosure calculations with empty intervals in
    ``Utils::Interval`` and ``Utils::Box``.
*   Fix kernel boundaries in the density estimation in
    ``Analyzers::NoiseScan``.

v1.0.0 (2017-02-07)
===================

This is the first version after a major refactoring. The basic design has not
changed much, but the internal structure and the user interface has undergone
significant changes. Users of the Judith software should be able to easily
convert their existing configurations to equivalent Proteus configurations.
However, this can not be done automatically and manual intervention is
required.

Starting from this version the software is released under the terms of
the MIT License and the documentation is released under the terms of
the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.

User-visible changes
--------------------

*   The software requires a C++11 compatible compiler and uses the
    `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_ build system.
*   All configuration files use the `TOML file format
    <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>`_.
*   The software uses a single, combined data stream as input that
    includes all telescope sensors and all devices-under-tests. There
    is no explicit distinction anymore between telescope sensors and
    device-under-test sensors.
*   The single Judith/proteus binary is split into multiple tools,
    i.e. *pt-noisescan*, *pt-align*, *pt-track*, *pt-match*, that each
    perform one specific task.
*   A new tool *pt-cfg* is available that checks configuration files and
    displays them.
*   The updated noise scan takes into account inhomogeneous occupancy
    distributions, e.g. due to the beam profile, and allows per-sensor
    configuration.
*   The alignment algorithm is simplified to be more robust for strong
    misalignment.
*   Pixel preprocessing, e.g. FE-I4 to CCPDv4 pixel mapping, and
    clusterization are fully integrated into the default analysis
    chain and do not require separate, manual steps.
*   Fitted track positions and device-under-test clusters are available
    also in a simple ``TTree``-based output format to allow specific
    analyses not covered by the existing tools.
*   The intermediate output ROOT file format, specifically the content
    of the ``TTree``, only contains the necessary local
    information. The positions and uncertainties in the global
    coordinate system are calculated automatically by the software.
    The input format is unchanged but any global position information
    is ignored.

Internal changes
----------------

*   All tools are now based on a generic event loop with configurable
    algorithms.
*   All geometry calculations are now based on ``ROOT::GenVector`` and
    correctly take into account the full rotation matrix and
    translation. Reconstruction and analysis is always performed in
    the local system of the sensor to be able to correctly handle
    missalignments and rotated sensors. The different transformations
    are fully included in the uncertainty calculations without
    additional constraints on the sensor orientation.
*   Uncertainty calculations and propagations use the full covariance
    matrix for both cluster and track uncertainties.
*   Search and matching cuts take into account the full covariance
    matrices.  The resulting `weighted distance measure
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance>`_ is used
    consistently throughout the code base.
*   Use a new non-recursive hit clusterizer with geometrical error
    calculation.  Different cluster property estimators, e.g. for
    binary measurements or for measurements with time-over-threshold
    measurement, are available that can be selected per sensor.
*   Updated track finder with fully configurable input sensors and
    global selection of the best candidates, i.e. tracks are selected
    from all found candidates with an exclusive association of
    clusters to tracks.
*   A continous build system is setup that compiles the software and
    runs example analyses on a regular basis.
