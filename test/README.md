Test configurations
===================

A set of example runs with configuration files and preconfigured analysis chain.
Comparison output files containing the expected results are provided. This
should allow a simple validation of changes to prevent functionality regressions
when changing the code.

**WARNING** This is *work-in-progress*

The following commands will build the software and run a full analysis chain.

    ./build.sh
    ./run_reference.sh
    ./run_dut.sh
